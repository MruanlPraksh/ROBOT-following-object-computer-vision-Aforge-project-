 Robotics project involving **computer vision** and **multithreading** in `C#` with a small mobile robot communicating with PC using `Xbee` module as shown in the demonstration [here](https://youtu.be/60YgQBg4V3Q).

This project involves creating a user interface using C# to view real-time video from a mobile robot, to use computer vision programming techinques to extract  red/blue coloured objects from the real-time video using filters and send commands to the robot to search and move towards the red/blue object.
The mobile communicates to the PC using XBee module and can receive manual commands from the user. The user can  also capture pictures of the object from the user interface. As well as select the colour of the object the robot needs to detect and move towards. The C# program uses backgroundWorker threads so that the user interface is responsive at all times.

The project source code can be viewed [here](https://github.com/Mrunal-G/Mobile-Robot-computer-vision-object-detection-and-tracking-multi-threaded-user-interface/blob/master/robotics/trObject1/Submit.cs)
